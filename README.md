# day_planner
This application allows users to save notes and appointments during a work day. Users simply have to write down whatever they need to in the row for each hour and click save. Each note is saved into local storage so that users can close the page and reopen it at a later time.

Depending on the time of day the section for each hour will display a different color. The current hour is in red. Upcoming hours are in green. Hours that have passed are in grey. Moment.js was integrated into the javascript for the time-based functionality.
