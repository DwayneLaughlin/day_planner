My first attempt to use an API in conjunction with javascript. I used some of the time strings from moment to create a running clock and date display on the top of the page. The ultimate goal is to have the textareas change colors based on whether or not the corresponding time has passed. I also wanted the inputs for each text area to save in local storage.
