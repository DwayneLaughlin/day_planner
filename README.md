# day_planner
This application allows users to save notes and appointments during a work day. Users simply have to write down whatever they need to in the row for each hour and click save. Each note is saved into local storage so that users can close the page and reopen it at a later time.

The date and time displays are controlled via Moment.js. Everything else is created with html and javascript.
